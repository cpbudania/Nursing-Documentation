# Unit - 1 | Cell

## Introduction
- Introduced by Robert Hook [1636-1703] (1665).
- The Word Cell is derived From Latin and It Means - "A Storeroom or A Chamber".
- Study of cell -> Cytology.
- Study of tissue -> Histology.
- Cell Theory Given By Scliender (1838).
- Nucleus -> Robert Brown (1831).
- Male Largest Cell -> Neuron (100 micron) (0.1mm).
- Female Largest Cell -> Ovum (130 micron).
- Male Smallest Cell -> Sperm (1 micron).

- The Cell is Smallest Structure And Functional Unit of the Body 
- Smallest unit of Body.
- A Living Structure and Functional unit is Enclosed by A Membrane Called Plasma Membrane / Cell Membrane.
- Each Cell have their unique Function eg. RBC transport oxygen from lungs to the tissue or cell.
- The Human Body develop from a single cell which is known as Zygote Which is result from the fusion of Ovum (Female Gametes) and Spermatozone Cell (Male Gametes).
- A typically Cell seen by Microscope is Consist Of 3 Basic Components 
  1. Cell Membrane / Plasma Membrane 
  2. Cytoplasm / Cell Organs
  3. Nucleus
- the Cell is the structural and Functional unit of yhe living matters and it is capable of carrying on the process of life independently.
- most of crll in human being have diameter of 10-20µm (Range 2-120µm).
- there are two types of cell division-
  1. Prokaryotic cell
  2. Eukaryotic cell

## Plasma Membrane
- It Forms the cell's Felxible outer Surface which internal & external environment.
- it is selective barrier which regulates the flow of material in and out of the cell.
- it contains cytoplasm of a cell.

### Structure of Plasma Membrane
- In microscope, examination show the cell membrane have triple layer structure having total thickness 7 to 10 nm.
- it is biochemically composed of -
  1. Lipid -> 40%
  2. Protein -> 55%
  3. Carbohydrates -> 5%
- All Membrane Consist of a double layer of a lipid molecule in which protein are embedded.
- Dome protein are located in inner surface of membrane and some are located in the outer surface of the membrane and some extend through the membrane (Trans Membrane Protein).
- The Cell Membrane consist of two portions
  1. Head end
  2. Tail end
> **Head end**
>
> > It is Soluble in Water (Hydrophilic)
  Hydro - Water, Philic - Loving of Water
>
> **Tail end**
> 
> > It is insoluble in water (Hydrophobic)
  Hydro- water, Phobic- Fear
